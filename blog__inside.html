                <p class="ford-left__p">The 2023 Ford F-150 has a new addition to its lineup: the Rattler trim. Aimed at
                    off-road enthusiasts,
                    the Rattler is based on the XL FX4 and comes equipped with features such as unique 18-inch wheels, a
                    dual-exhaust system, hill-descent control, and a locking rear differential. It also has an off-road
                    suspension system and rattlesnake-inspired logos throughout the design. This trim level offers a
                    more
                    budget-friendly option for those seeking added off-road capabilities without splurging on the
                    pricier
                    Tremor or Raptor models. It's no wonder the F-150 consistently ranks as one of the best pickup
                    trucks on
                    the market. But how does it compare to the 2023 Ram 1500?</p>

            <h2 class="engine__h2">Engine Comparison</h2>
            <p class="engine__p">The Ford F-150 has several engine options that the Ram 1500 doesn't have. The F-150 can
                come with a 290-horsepower 3.3-liter V-6, a 400-horsepower 5.0-liter V-8, a 325-horsepower
                twin-turbocharged
                2.7-liter V-6, a 400-horsepower twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6, or a 250-horsepower 3.0-liter diesel
                V-6.
                The quickest of these engines allows the F-150 to go from 0 to 60 mph in 5.8 to 6.6 seconds, making it
                one
                of the fastest trucks in its class.</p>
            <p class="engine__p-2"> In comparison, the Ram 1500's top engine option is a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 that
                produces
                395 horsepower and 410
                lb-ft of torque. While this engine is certainly powerful, it falls short of the F-150's V-6 in terms of
                both
                horsepower and torque. The Ram 1500's dues come up on top in terms of top speed of 118 mph, while the
                F-150
                can reach 110 mph governed top speed.</p>

                <h1 class="fual-left__h1">Fuel Efficiency</h1>
                <p class="fual-left__p">In terms of fuel efficiency, both trucks are fairly similar. The F-150's V-6
                    engine gets an EPA-estimated 18 mpg combined, while the Ram 1500's V-8 engine gets just 23 mpg
                    combined. Yet the F-150 is available with a hybrid powertrain that gets an impressive 24 mpg
                    combined, making it one of the most fuel-efficient trucks on the market.</p>

            <h2 class="features__h2">Features</h2>
            <p class="features__p">The F-150 also boasts a number of convenience features that make it a more attractive
                option for drivers. It offers a range of advanced driver assist technologies, including automatic
                emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and lane-keeping assist. These features can help make
                driving safer and more delightful, especially on long trips. The F-150 is also available with a
                360-degree camera system that makes it easier to navigate tight spaces and maneuver around obstacles,
                even more handy when attaching a trailer or back load.</p>
            <p class="features__p-2">In terms of interior comfort and cargo space, both the F-150 and the Ram 1500 offer
                plenty of room for passengers and their belongings. The F-150 has 136 cubic feet of passenger volume and
                a maximum payload capacity of 3,270 pounds, while the Ram 1500 has 141 cubic feet of passenger volume
                and a maximum payload capacity of 2,300 pounds. Both trucks also offer plenty of storage options,
                including in-floor storage compartments and under-seat storage.</p>
